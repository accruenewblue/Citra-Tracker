# Orange Peeler

Tracker for Gen 6/7 Pokémon Ironmon.

Specifically, this includes:

    --Pokémon X/Y

    --Pokémon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire

    --Pokémon Sun/Moon

    --Pokémon Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon


Tracking options are available as the following:

    --Ability to save details about each mon

    --Details about moves, abilities and mons

    --Display features for your mon


How to Use:
 
Citra emulator for 3DS is required. Drop the files in the folder into the citra scripting folder(the one with a citra.py inside, usually in appdata/local) and run the Tracker.py and citra-updater.py simultaneously.

Keep in mind this is an alpha version, do not expect perfection right now.

Thanks to UTDZac for helping with some of the features being imported from Citra, and something_smart_ for the move level up sets. Otherwise, thank Bulbapedia for the helpful lists I used.
