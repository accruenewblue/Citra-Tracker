# Orange Peeler
 Peels Oranges.

Type Calculator for Gen 6/7 Pokémon.
Specifically, this includes:
    --Pokémon X/Y
    --Pokémon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire
    --Pokémon Sun/Moon
    --Pokémon Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon

Tracking options are available as the following:
    --General "string" notes
    --Specific notes for each of each mon's stats
    --Slots to add in abilities and moves

Move effectiveness is calculated based on:
    --type matchups
    --current weather
    --attacking mon's ability
    --move base power
    to calculate an "effective base power" to be shown.

How to Use:
In the future, Citra emulator for 3DS will be required. However, for now, it uses a txt file interface until a proper one can be developed. 
If you were looking for different games, there are trackers available for the [NDS games](https://github.com/Brian0255/NDS-Ironmon-Tracker)(DPPt, HGSS, BW, B2W2) requiring Bizhawk and the [GBA games](https://github.com/besteon/Ironmon-Tracker)(FRLG, RSE) using Bizhawk or mGBA games.
